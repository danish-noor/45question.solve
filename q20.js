//Q20. Think of something you could store in an array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.
var countries = ["Turkey", "Canada", "London", "Japan", "Rome"];
console.log("List of Countries I'd like to visit:", countries.forEach(function (country) {
    console.log(country);
}));
