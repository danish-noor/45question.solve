//Q20. Think of something you could store in an array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

let countries: string[] = ["Turkey","Canada","London","Japan","Rome"];

console.log("List of Countries I'd like to visit:", countries.forEach(country=>{
    console.log(country);
    
}));
