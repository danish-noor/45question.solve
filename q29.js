//Q29.Favorite Fruit: Make a array of your favorite fruits, and then write a series of independent if statements that check for certain fruits in your array.
// • Make a array of your three favorite fruits and call it favorite_fruits.
// • Write five if statements. Each should check whether a certain kind of fruit is in your array. If the fruit is in your array, the if block should print a statement, such as You really like bananas!
var favorite_fruits = ["Apple", "Bananas", "Orange", "Mango", "strawberry",];
// Check if "Apple" is in the array
if (favorite_fruits.includes("Apple")) {
    console.log("you really like to eat Apples!");
}
// Check if "Banana" is in the array
if (favorite_fruits.includes("Bananas")) {
    console.log("you really like to eat Bananas!");
}
// Check if "Orange" is in the array
if (favorite_fruits.includes("Orange")) {
    console.log("you really like to eat Oranges!");
}
// Check if "Mango" is in the array
if (favorite_fruits.includes("Mango")) {
    console.log("you really like to eat Mangoes!");
}
// Check if "strawberry" is in the array
if (favorite_fruits.includes("strawberry")) {
    console.log("you really like to eat strawberries!");
}
